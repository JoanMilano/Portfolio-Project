 github:
 branches: for working on specific areas of
  the code without updating main branch.
  while in that branch you have the version
  of the code from when it was created to
   what your creating/deleting. when 
   switching to a dif branch those edits 
   stay in the branch until their merged 
   into another branch (not just the main)

  merge: branch > merge into current branch
  to merge external branches into main. start 
  in the branch that you want the other branch into  
  (start in main and merge v2)

   pull requests: used on teams so the code
    can be reviewed before added to main. 
    the code branch itself is first published 
    where other people part of the project
     can view, edit, and merge it into the main
